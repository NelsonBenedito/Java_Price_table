# Price management table in java #
*A simple console-based application called PriceTable. It allows the user to perform various operations related to product prices*

Defines two arrays, one for product codes (vetCod) and another for the corresponding product prices (vetPreco). <br>
`int[] vetCod = { 32, 42, 55, 79, 87, 148, 243 };` <br>
`double[] vetPreco = { 1.10, 16.50, 2.00, 23.70, 15.20, 3.80, 17.20 };` <br>
Presents a menu to the user with the following options: <br>
> * Check the price of a product by entering its code. <br>
> * Change the price of a product by entering its code. <br>
> * Find the product code with the highest price. <br>
> * Exit the program. <br>
